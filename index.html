         Hello.  My name is Rohan.  I am a freshman at Glenbrook South Highschool.  My favorite color is blue.  My hobbies are playing videogames, practicing and playing golf, 
         riding my bike, playing board games, and spending time with family.  My favorite videogames are Minecraft, Among Us, and Tetris.  My favorite board games are Memoir '44 (which allows me to 
         express my love for learning about World War II), Ticket to Ride, and Catan.  I like collecting/downloading images from Bing Wallaper because they are cool, informative, and inspire me with the photos 
         I take on international and national trips.       
       </p>
       <p>
         I coded this splash page using a combination of HTML and CSS, which my Web Development 161 class help me complete.  Coding is another one of 
         my hobbies.  I like to code using Unity and Codepen.  On Unity, I code games that are 2D and 3D.  One example of a game I coded was Flappy 
         Bird, but the tubes that the bird has to go through were spikes.
